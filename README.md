# Loan-Repayment-Prediction-ML
Loan Approval Prediction uses machine learning to analyze factors like income and credit history, automating and improving the loan approval process. The project ensures accurate, efficient, and user-friendly predictions with a Gradio interface.


## 📖 Overview
Loan approval prediction is a critical task in the banking and finance industry. This project leverages machine learning to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on features such as applicant income, credit history, loan amount, and more. By automating the decision-making process, this system aims to reduce risks for financial institutions and improve customer satisfaction.

## 🚀 Features
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses multiple algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks.
- **Dynamic Output**: Displays prediction results with color-coded status (e.g., "Approved" in green, "Rejected" in red).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Gradio for real-time loan status prediction.
- **Feature Analysis**: Explores the impact of different features like credit history and income on loan approval.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`: Data manipulation and preprocessing
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning model development
  - `gradio`: Building interactive interfaces
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Description**: The dataset includes key features such as:
  - Applicant's Income
  - Coapplicant's Income
  - Loan Amount
  - Credit History
  - Property Area
- **Source**: (Mention if it’s from Kaggle, UCI, or custom data)
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Balancing classes with SMOTE

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, scaling, and encoding data for optimal model performance.
2. **Model Training**:
   - Trains multiple algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and evaluates them using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
3. **Deployment**:
   - Uses Gradio for an interactive prediction interface.
4. **Dynamic Output**:
   - Displays predictions with color-coded text to indicate loan status.

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions.
- **Precision**: Reducing false positives (risky loans predicted as safe).
- **Recall**: Reducing false negatives (safe loans predicted as risky).
- **ROC-AUC**: Assessing model discrimination between approved and rejected loans.
